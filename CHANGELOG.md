# Changelog

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->

All notable changes to the Specify CLI and templates are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **Worktrunk Integration**: Replaced `git checkout -b` branching with `wt switch --create` for worktree-based feature development
  - Each feature now gets its own isolated worktree via [Worktrunk](https://worktrunk.dev)
  - `wt` check added to `specify check` command output
  - `wt` prerequisite warning added to `specify init` flow
  - Added `has_wt()` helper function to `common.sh`

### Changed

- **Branch creation**: `create-new-feature.sh` now uses `wt switch --create` instead of `git checkout -b`
- **Script consolidation**: Removed `--script` CLI option from `specify init` (bash-only)
- **Command templates**: All command templates now reference only `sh:` scripts (removed `ps:` frontmatter entries)
- **Prerequisites**: Updated README and CONTRIBUTING docs to list Worktrunk as a prerequisite

### Removed

- **PowerShell scripts**: Removed all `.ps1` scripts (`common.ps1`, `create-new-feature.ps1`, `setup-plan.ps1`, `check-prerequisites.ps1`, `update-agent-context.ps1`). Worktrunk is a cross-platform Rust binary; bash scripts run via Git Bash on Windows or WSL.
- **Script type selection**: Removed `SCRIPT_TYPE_CHOICES` and the interactive script-type picker from `specify init`

### Breaking Changes

- PowerShell script support has been removed. Windows users should use Git Bash or WSL.
- The `--script` option on `specify init` no longer exists.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-28

### Added

- **Extension System**: Introduced modular extension architecture for Spec Kit
  - Extensions are self-contained packages that add commands and functionality without bloating core
  - Extension manifest schema (`extension.yml`) with validation
  - Extension registry (`.specify/extensions/.registry`) for tracking installed extensions
  - Extension manager module (`src/specify_cli/extensions.py`) for installation/removal

    - `specify extension remove` - Uninstall extension
    - `specify extension search` - Search extension catalog
    - `specify extension info` - Show detailed extension information
  - Semantic versioning compatibility checks
  - Support for extension configuration files
  - Command registration system for AI agents (Claude support initially)
  - Added dependencies: `pyyaml>=6.0`, `packaging>=23.0`

- **Extension Catalog**: Extension discovery and distribution system
  - Central catalog (`extensions/catalog.json`) for published extensions
  - Extension catalog manager (`ExtensionCatalog` class) with:
    - Catalog fetching from GitHub
    - 1-hour local caching for performance
    - Search by query, tag, author, or verification status
    - Extension info retrieval
  - Catalog cache stored in `.specify/extensions/.cache/`

  - Agent-specific command formats (Markdown and TOML)
  - Automatic argument placeholder conversion ($ARGUMENTS → {{args}})
  - Commands registered for all detected agents during installation
  - Multi-agent command unregistration on extension removal
  - `CommandRegistrar.register_commands_for_agent()` method
  - `CommandRegistrar.register_commands_for_all_agents()` method

- Move to use `AGENTS.md` for Copilot workloads, since it's already supported out-of-the-box.
- Adds support for the version command. ([#486](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/486))
- Fixes potential bug with the `create-new-feature.ps1` script that ignores existing feature branches when determining next feature number ([#975](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/975))
- Add graceful fallback and logging for GitHub API rate-limiting during template fetch ([#970](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/970))

## [0.0.21] - 2025-10-21

- Adds support for `version` command (addresses [#811](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/811) and [#486](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/486), thank you [@mcasalaina](https://github.com/mcasalaina) and [@dentity007](https://github.com/dentity007)).
- Adds support for rendering the rate limit errors from the CLI when encountered ([#970](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/970), thank you [@psmman](https://github.com/psmman)).

## [0.0.20] - 2025-10-14

### Added

- **Intelligent Branch Naming**: `create-new-feature` scripts now support `--short-name` parameter for custom branch names
  - When `--short-name` provided: Uses the custom name directly (cleaned and formatted)
  - When omitted: Automatically generates meaningful names using stop word filtering and length-based filtering
  - Filters out common stop words (I, want, to, the, for, etc.)
  - Removes words shorter than 3 characters (unless they're uppercase acronyms)
  - Takes 3-4 most meaningful words from the description
  - **Enforces GitHub's 244-byte branch name limit** with automatic truncation and warnings
  - Examples:
    - "I want to create user authentication" → `001-create-user-authentication`
    - "Implement OAuth2 integration for API" → `001-implement-oauth2-integration-api`
    - "Fix payment processing bug" → `001-fix-payment-processing`
    - Very long descriptions are automatically truncated at word boundaries to stay within limits
  - Designed for AI agents to provide semantic short names while maintaining standalone usability

### Changed

- Enhanced help documentation for `create-new-feature.sh` and `create-new-feature.ps1` scripts with examples
- Branch names now validated against GitHub's 244-byte limit with automatic truncation if needed

## [0.0.19] - 2025-10-10

### Added

- Support for CodeBuddy (thank you to [@lispking](https://github.com/lispking) for the contribution).
- You can now see Git-sourced errors in the Specify CLI.

### Changed

- Fixed the path to the constitution in `plan.md` (thank you to [@lyzno1](https://github.com/lyzno1) for spotting).
- Fixed backslash escapes in generated TOML files for Gemini (thank you to [@hsin19](https://github.com/hsin19) for the contribution).
- Implementation command now ensures that the correct ignore files are added (thank you to [@sigent-amazon](https://github.com/sigent-amazon) for the contribution).

## [0.0.18] - 2025-10-06

### Added

- Support for using `.` as a shorthand for current directory in `specify init .` command, equivalent to `--here` flag but more intuitive for users.
- Use the `/speckit.` command prefix to easily discover Spec Kit-related commands.
- Refactor the prompts and templates to simplify their capabilities and how they are tracked. No more polluting things with tests when they are not needed.
- Ensure that tasks are created per user story (simplifies testing and validation).
- Add support for Visual Studio Code prompt shortcuts and automatic script execution.

### Changed

- All command files now prefixed with `speckit.` (e.g., `speckit.specify.md`, `speckit.plan.md`) for better discoverability and differentiation in IDE/CLI command palettes and file explorers

## [0.0.17] - 2025-09-22

### Added

- New `/clarify` command template to surface up to 5 targeted clarification questions for an existing spec and persist answers into a Clarifications section in the spec.
- New `/analyze` command template providing a non-destructive cross-artifact discrepancy and alignment report (spec, clarifications, plan, tasks, constitution) inserted after `/tasks` and before `/implement`.
  - Note: Constitution rules are explicitly treated as non-negotiable; any conflict is a CRITICAL finding requiring artifact remediation, not weakening of principles.

## [0.0.16] - 2025-09-22

### Added

- `--force` flag for `init` command to bypass confirmation when using `--here` in a non-empty directory and proceed with merging/overwriting files.

- Cleaned up the `check` command output.

## [0.0.12] - 2025-09-21
